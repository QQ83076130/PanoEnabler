PanoEnabler
===========

Enable Panorama and Customize it.

Compatibility
===========

- iPhone 4 (Reduced panoramic capture resolution)
- iPhone 4S
- iPhone 5
- iPod touch 4G
- iPod touch 5G (32/64 GB)
- iPad 2
- iPad 3
- iPad 4
- iPad mini 1G

Tested in iOS 6.0.0 - 6.1.3

IMPORTANT
===========

- Doesn't fully working in A4 iDevices due to iOS compatibility reason and you can only get about 30% sizes of Panoramic image because I replace the actual image one that won't be generated with its thumbnail.
- You can tell me to improve any codes or if you found out how to make it fully working in A4 iDevices.
- Thanks for all Beta Testers for this tweak !
